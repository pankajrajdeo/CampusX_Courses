# Lecture Notes: Introduction to LangChain & Generative AI (User Side)

## 1. Context & Motivation

* **Instructor**: Nitesh
* **Lecture Focus**: Generative AI (User-side curriculum).
* **Goal**: End-to-end coverage of building LLM-based applications, starting with **LangChain**.
* **Two sides of Generative AI**:

  1. **Builder side**: Focused on creating foundation models (Transformers, training, fine-tuning, optimization).
  2. **User side**: Focused on using foundation models to build applications.
* This playlist belongs to the **User side**.

## 2. Why Start with LangChain?

* **Holistic entry point**:

  * Offers exposure to multiple areas: LLM APIs, Prompt Engineering, RAG, Agents, LLMOps.
  * Supports both **open-source** (Hugging Face, Ollama) and **closed-source** (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude) models.
* Helps gain a **flavor of multiple techniques** early:

  * Prompt engineering
  * Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  * Building AI agents
  * Initial exposure to LLMOps concepts
* Plan: After LangChain, deeper dedicated playlists will follow on:

  * Prompt Engineering
  * Advanced RAG
  * Agents

## 3. What is LangChain?

* **Definition**:
  An **open-source framework** to build **LLM-based applications** such as chatbots, Q\&A systems, RAG pipelines, and AI agents.
* **Core Features**:

  1. **Wide LLM support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Ollama, and others.
  2. **Simplifies development**: Provides abstractions like **Chains** for building complex workflows.
  3. **Integrations**: Built-in connectors for databases, remote sources, and deployment tools.
  4. **Open-source & free**: Actively maintained with frequent updates.
  5. **Supports all major GenAI use cases**: Chatbots, RAG applications, autonomous agents.

## 4. Core Concepts in LangChain

* **Chains**: Sequential workflows where the output of one step becomes the input of the next.
* **Memory**: Mechanism to preserve conversational history in chatbots.
* **Integrations**: Wrappers to easily connect with external tools (databases, APIs, etc.).
* **Runables (LCEL)**: New abstractions in LangChain 3.x for executing LLM tasks modularly.

**Example (basic chain in Python):**

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

# Create an LLM instance
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Define a prompt template
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["topic"],
    template="Explain {topic} in simple terms."
)

# Build the chain
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Run it
response = chain.run("quantum computing")
print(response)
```

## 6. Focus Areas of the Playlist

1. **Latest version (LangChain 3.x)**:
   Playlist built fully on **v3**, as earlier versions (0.x, 0.2) differ significantly.
2. **Clarity**: Not just coding demos, but explaining "why" and "how" things work under the hood.
3. **Conceptual understanding**: So learners can adapt to future versions (e.g., v4).
4. **Coverage**: \~80% of LangChain (most useful parts). Avoid unnecessary/uncommon features.

---

## 7. Timeline

* Playlist launch: Within 1â€“2 days.
* Frequency: **2 videos per week**.
* Duration: \~8 weeks (\~2 months) to cover the entire playlist.
* Allows enough time for learners to **practice** between lessons.

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

* **LangChain = entry point** for user-side Generative AI.
* Provides a **holistic view** of LLM-based application building.
* Supports all major use cases (chatbots, RAG, agents).
* Curriculum designed for **clarity + practical coding + conceptual depth**.
* Playlist will focus on **LangChain v3** (most up-to-date).

---

âœ… **Revision Tip**: While revising, focus on:

* Understanding the **flow of LLM apps** (input â†’ processing â†’ output).
* Practicing with small code snippets (Chains, Prompts, Memory).
* Connecting concepts like RAG and Agents back to **LangChain abstractions**.
