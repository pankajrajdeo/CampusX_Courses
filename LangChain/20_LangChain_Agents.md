# Lecture Notes: Building AI Agents with LangChain

## 1. Introduction

* This lecture is the **18th and final video** (in the initial plan) of the LangChain playlist.
* Focus: **AI Agents** in LangChain.
* Structure:

  1. Conceptual introduction to AI Agents.
  2. Practical coding of a basic AI Agent in LangChain.

---

## 2. Motivation: Why AI Agents?

* **Problem Example: Planning a Trip (Delhi ‚Üí Goa)**
  Without AI Agents, a user must manually:

  1. Decide travel dates.
  2. Book tickets (flight/train via IRCTC, MakeMyTrip).
  3. Book hotels (compare prices, reviews, breakfast options).
  4. Plan itinerary (search top attractions, book cabs/tickets).
  5. Make multiple payments, confirmations, and adjustments.

  ‚Üí Time-consuming, requires technical knowledge, often **difficult for elderly or non-tech-savvy users**.

* **With AI Agents:**

  * User simply states the **goal**:
    *‚ÄúPlan a budget travel itinerary from Delhi to Goa, May 1‚Äì7.‚Äù*
  * Agent:

    * Understands intent.
    * Fetches travel, hotel, activity options via tools/APIs.
    * Compares prices, availability, preferences.
    * Step-by-step books and finalizes.
    * Handles **memory** (remembers earlier choices).
    * Automates payments, invoices, calendar events, reminders.

üëâ Result: **Seamless user experience**; user effort minimized.

## 3. What is an AI Agent?

### Definition

> An **AI Agent** is an intelligent system that:
>
> * Receives a **high-level goal** from a user.
> * Autonomously **plans, decides, and executes** a sequence of actions.
> * Uses **tools, APIs, and knowledge sources**.
> * Maintains context, reasons over multiple steps, adapts to new information, and optimizes for the intended outcome.

### Simplified

* User sets a **goal** ‚Üí Agent figures out **how** to achieve it.
* Powered by:

  1. **LLM** ‚Üí reasoning engine.
  2. **Tools/APIs** ‚Üí perform external actions.

### Key Difference (LLM vs AI Agent)

* **LLM only**: good at reasoning, but can‚Äôt execute actions.
* **AI Agent**: combines LLM + tools to act in the real world (e.g., book tickets, fetch live data).

---

## 4. Characteristics of AI Agents

1. **Goal-driven** ‚Äì only needs a task, not step-by-step instructions.
2. **Planning ability** ‚Äì can break down problems into steps.
3. **Tool-awareness** ‚Äì knows which tools it has and when to use them.
4. **Context retention** ‚Äì maintains conversation memory, user preferences, and progress.
5. **Adaptability** ‚Äì replans if tools fail or new information arrives.

---

## 5. Coding AI Agents in LangChain

### Setup

1. Install libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install langchain-openai langchain-community duckduckgo-search
   ```
2. Import dependencies:

   ```python
   from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
   from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
   from langchain import hub
   from langchain.agents import create_react_agent, AgentExecutor
   ```

### Step 1: Define a Tool

* Example: DuckDuckGo Search.

  ```python
  search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()
  result = search_tool.run("Top news in India today")
  print(result)
  ```

### Step 2: Define an LLM

```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)
print(llm.invoke("Hi"))
```

### Step 3: Create a ReAct Agent

* ReAct = **Reasoning + Acting** (design pattern).

* Load ReAct prompt from LangChain Hub:

  ```python
  react_prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react")
  ```

* Create the agent:

  ```python
  agent = create_react_agent(
      llm=llm,
      tools=[search_tool],
      prompt=react_prompt
  )
  ```

### Step 4: Create an Agent Executor

* Handles execution of agent‚Äôs plan.

```python
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=[search_tool], verbose=True)
```

### Step 5: Run Queries

```python
query = "What are the three ways to reach Goa from Delhi?"
response = agent_executor.invoke({"input": query})
print(response["output"])
```

Example Output:

```
The three common ways to reach Goa from Delhi are by air, train, and road.
```

## 6. Understanding ReAct

### Concept

* ReAct = **Reasoning + Acting**.
* Interleaves **thoughts** (reasoning) and **actions** (tool use).
* Runs in a loop until answer is found.

### Loop Structure

1. **Thought** ‚Äì reasoning step.
2. **Action** ‚Äì tool call.
3. **Observation** ‚Äì tool result.
4. Repeat until final answer is ready.

### Example

Query: *‚ÄúWhat is the population of the capital of France?‚Äù*

1. Thought: I need to find France‚Äôs capital.
   ‚Üí Action: search(‚Äúcapital of France‚Äù).
   ‚Üí Observation: Paris.
2. Thought: I need Paris‚Äôs population.
   ‚Üí Action: search(‚Äúpopulation of Paris‚Äù).
   ‚Üí Observation: 2.1M.
3. Thought: I have final answer.
   ‚Üí Output: ‚ÄúParis is the capital of France with a population of 2.1M.‚Äù

### Advantages

* Transparent reasoning (thoughts visible to user).
* Good for **multi-step problems**.
* Useful when **tool usage** (search, APIs) is needed.

## 7. Summary Flow of AI Agent in LangChain

1. **Define Tools** (search, APIs, DB access).
2. **Create LLM** (reasoning engine).
3. **Select Design Pattern** (ReAct in this lecture).
4. **Create Agent** (combines LLM + tools + prompt).
5. **Wrap in Agent Executor** (executes step-by-step).
6. **Run Queries** (agent autonomously solves with reasoning + tools).

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

* AI Agents = **LLM + Tools + Context**.
* They solve real-world problems (like trip planning) seamlessly.
* **ReAct pattern** is widely used for structured multi-step reasoning.
* LangChain provides:

  * Tools integration.
  * Predefined prompts via Hub.
  * Executor for managing reasoning + action loop.

# Lecture Notes: Agents & Agent Executor in LangChain (ReAct Pattern)

## 1. Introduction

* **Agents**: Decision-makers. They decide which *action/tool* to use at each step.
* **Agent Executor**: The orchestrator. It manages the loop of **Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation** until a final answer is reached.
* Together, they implement the **ReAct (Reason + Act)** pattern.

---

## 2. ReAct Loop

The ReAct pattern runs a continuous cycle:

1. **Thought** ‚Äì The agent reasons: ‚ÄúWhat should I do next?‚Äù
2. **Action** ‚Äì The agent picks a tool and provides input.
3. **Observation** ‚Äì The result from the tool.
4. Loop continues until the agent declares: *‚ÄúI now know the final answer.‚Äù*

üîë **Key Point**: The **Agent Executor** is responsible for running this loop.

---

## 3. Agent Executor‚Äôs Role

* Starts the loop.
* Sends two things to the Agent:

  1. **User query**
  2. **Thought trace (a.k.a. Agent Scratchpad)** ‚Üí history of all past steps.

### Example Flow

User Query: *"Tell me the population of the capital of France."*

* Iteration 1:

  * Agent receives query + empty scratchpad.
  * Thinks: *"I need to find the capital of France."*
  * Action: Use `search_tool("capital of France")`.
  * Observation: `Paris`.
  * Executor updates scratchpad with this result.

* Iteration 2:

  * Query + updated scratchpad sent again.
  * Agent thinks: *"Now find the population of Paris."*
  * Action: Use `search_tool("population of Paris")`.
  * Observation: `2.1 million`.
  * Scratchpad updated.

* Iteration 3:

  * Agent concludes: *"Final answer: Paris has a population of 2.1 million."*
  * Loop ends.

---

## 4. Creating an Agent

Agents are created using `create_react_agent()`.

### Requirements

1. **LLM** (e.g., `ChatOpenAI`)
2. **Prompt** ‚Äì guides the agent on how to follow ReAct format.

Prompts usually specify:

* List of available tools.
* Format:

  ```text
  Question: <user question>  
  Thought: <agent reasoning>  
  Action: <tool name>  
  Action Input: <tool input>  
  Observation: <tool output>  
  ```
* Loop until: *‚ÄúI now know the final answer.‚Äù*

### Example: Creating an Agent

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain import hub
from langchain.agents import create_react_agent

# 1. LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")

# 2. Prompt (from LangChain Hub)
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react")

# 3. Create agent
agent = create_react_agent(llm=llm, tools=[search_tool], prompt=prompt)
```

üîë The agent object can take:

* **User query**
* **Scratchpad (thought trace)**
  And return:
* Either an **Action** (to be executed), or
* A **Final Output**.

---

## 5. Creating an Agent Executor

The **Agent Executor** runs the loop.

### Example

```python
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor

executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=[search_tool])
```

**Responsibilities**:

1. Orchestrates the full loop.
2. Executes tools.
3. Collects and updates observations.

---

## 6. Internal Objects

* **AgentAction Object**
  Contains:

  * `tool` ‚Üí which tool to call
  * `tool_input` ‚Üí input for that tool
  * `log` ‚Üí current scratchpad state

* **AgentFinish Object**
  Contains:

  * `return_values` ‚Üí final output
  * `log` ‚Üí final scratchpad state

---

## 7. Flow Diagram (Conceptual)

```
User Query
    ‚Üì
Agent Executor
    ‚Üì
Agent (query + scratchpad)
    ‚Üì

    ‚Ü∫ (loop continues)
Until AgentFinish ‚Üí Final Answer
```

---

## 8. Example Walkthrough

**User Query**:
*"What is the capital of France and what is its population?"*

### Iteration 1:

* Thought: *"Find capital of France."*
* Action: `search_tool("capital of France")`
* Observation: `Paris`
* Scratchpad updated.

### Iteration 2:

* Thought: *"Find population of Paris."*
* Action: `search_tool("population of Paris")`
* Observation: `2.1 million`
* Scratchpad updated.

### Iteration 3:

* Thought: *"I now know the final answer."*
* Final Answer: `Paris has a population of 2.1 million.`

---

## 9. Improving the Code (Adding Custom Tools)

We can add custom tools using the `@tool` decorator.
Example: **Weather Tool** using WeatherStack API.

```python
from langchain.tools import tool
import requests

@tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    url = f"http://api.weatherstack.com/current?access_key={api_key}&query={city}"
    response = requests.get(url).json()
    weather = response['current']
    return f"{city}: {weather['temperature']}¬∞C, {weather['weather_descriptions'][0]}"
```

### Updating the Agent

```python
tools = [search_tool, get_weather]
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt)
executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)
```

### Example Query

*"Find the capital of Madhya Pradesh and its current weather."*

Execution Flow:

1. Thought: *"Find capital of Madhya Pradesh."*
   ‚Üí Action: `search_tool("capital of Madhya Pradesh")` ‚Üí Observation: `Bhopal`.
2. Thought: *"Check weather in Bhopal."*
   ‚Üí Action: `get_weather("Bhopal")` ‚Üí Observation: `40¬∞C, Partly Cloudy`.
3. Final Answer: *"The capital of Madhya Pradesh is Bhopal. Current weather: 40¬∞C, Partly Cloudy."*

## 10. Current Status and Future

* **LangChain Agents** are possible but **not recommended** for scalable production AI agents.
* **LangGraph** (new library by LangChain team) is suggested for industry-grade, scalable agents.
* This lecture used LangChain to **demonstrate the concepts**, not as the final recommended solution.

---

## 11. Key Takeaways

* **Agent**: Decides next action (via Thought ‚Üí Action).
* **Agent Executor**: Runs the loop, executes tools, updates scratchpad.
* **Scratchpad**: Maintains memory of all steps.
* **ReAct Pattern**: Iterative reasoning + acting until a final answer.
* **Custom Tools**: Extend agent abilities (e.g., weather API).
* **LangGraph > LangChain** for real-world scaling.

---

‚úÖ By now, you should be able to:

* Explain how ReAct works.
* Write code to build an agent + executor.
* Add custom tools.
* Understand the flow of AgentAction & AgentFinish.
