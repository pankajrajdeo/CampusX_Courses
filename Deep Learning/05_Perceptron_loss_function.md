# Lecture Notes: **Loss Functions in Perceptron**

---

## 1. Recap: What is a Perceptron?

* **Definition**: A perceptron is a mathematical model inspired by biological neurons.

* **Structure**:

  * Inputs $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$
  * Weights $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$
  * Bias $b$
  * Linear combination:

    $$
    z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_nx_n + b
    $$
  * Activation function (e.g., **step function**):

    $$
    f(z) =
      \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } z \geq 0 \\
        0 & \text{if } z < 0
      \end{cases}
    $$

* **Geometric Intuition**:

  * The perceptron is essentially a **line (or hyperplane)** that separates data into two classes.
  * Used for **binary classification**.

---

## 2. Perceptron Trick (Earlier Method)

* Algorithm (heuristic):

  1. Start with random weights and bias.
  2. Pick a random data point.
  3. If misclassified, adjust the line by updating weights/bias.
  4. Repeat many times until separation appears correct.

* **Problem with Perceptron Trick**:

  * May not converge in rare cases.
  * Even if it converges, multiple separating lines are possible—no guarantee of finding the *best* line.
  * Cannot **quantify how good** one line is compared to another.

---

## 3. Need for Loss Functions

* In machine learning, we don’t rely on heuristics.
* **Loss functions** allow us to:

  * Quantify how good/bad a model is.
  * Optimize towards the best solution.

**Definition**:
A **loss function** is a mathematical function that outputs a number representing the error of a model. Lower values = better model.

---

## 4. Simple Loss Function Examples

### A. Misclassification Count

* Count the number of wrongly classified points.

$$
\text{Loss} = \#\{ \text{misclassified points} \}
$$

*Limitation*: Treats all errors equally, regardless of how far misclassified points are from the decision boundary.

### B. Distance-based Loss

* Weight errors by their distance from the line.

$$
\text{Loss} = \sum_{\text{misclassified points}} \text{distance to line}
$$

This penalizes “large mistakes” more than small ones.

---

## 5. Perceptron Loss Function (Formal)

In practice, the perceptron uses a special loss function called **hinge loss** (simplified form):

$$
L(w, b) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \max \big(0, -y_i (w \cdot x_i + b)\big)
$$

Where:

* $(x_i, y_i)$ is a data point.
* $y_i \in \{+1, -1\}$.
* $w \cdot x_i + b$ is the linear output.
* If correctly classified → contribution = 0.
* If misclassified → positive contribution proportional to margin.

**Key Idea**:

* Correct classifications = no penalty.
* Misclassifications = penalty based on how badly they were misclassified.

---

## 6. Optimization with Gradient Descent

* **Goal**: Minimize the loss function by finding optimal weights and bias.

### Gradient Descent Update Rules:

$$
w_1 \leftarrow w_1 - \eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1}
$$

$$
w_2 \leftarrow w_2 - \eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_2}
$$

$$
b \leftarrow b - \eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial b}
$$

Where:

* $\eta$ = learning rate.
* Derivatives are computed from the loss function.

---

## 7. Geometric Intuition of Loss Function

* If point is **correctly classified** → contributes 0 to loss.
* If point is **misclassified** → contributes a positive value.
* Hence, the loss function is directly tied to the number and severity of misclassifications.

---

## 8. Flexibility of Perceptron

The perceptron’s design is **flexible** because you can swap:

* **Activation function**
* **Loss function**

This leads to different machine learning algorithms.

### Case 1: Step Function + Hinge Loss

* Standard Perceptron
* Binary outputs (0 or 1)

### Case 2: Sigmoid Function + Binary Cross-Entropy

* Logistic Regression
* Outputs probabilities between 0 and 1

Formula (Binary Cross-Entropy Loss):

$$
L = -\big(y \log(\hat{y}) + (1-y)\log(1-\hat{y})\big)
$$

### Case 3: Softmax + Categorical Cross-Entropy

* Multiclass Classification
* Output = probability distribution over multiple classes

Formula:

$$
L = -\sum_{i=1}^K y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
$$

### Case 4: Linear Activation + Mean Squared Error

* Linear Regression
* Output = continuous value

Formula:

$$
L = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

## 9. Python Example: Perceptron Training with Loss

```python
import numpy as np

# Simple perceptron implementation
def perceptron(X, y, learning_rate=0.1, epochs=1000):
    n_samples, n_features = X.shape
    w = np.zeros(n_features)
    b = 0

    for _ in range(epochs):
        for idx, x_i in enumerate(X):
            linear_output = np.dot(x_i, w) + b
            y_pred = np.where(linear_output >= 0, 1, -1)
            
            # Perceptron update rule
            if y[idx] * linear_output <= 0:
                w += learning_rate * y[idx] * x_i
                b += learning_rate * y[idx]
    return w, b

# Example dataset
X = np.array([[2,3],[4,1],[1,6],[5,7]])
y = np.array([1, -1, 1, -1])  # class labels

weights, bias = perceptron(X, y)
print("Final Weights:", weights, "Bias:", bias)
```

## 10. Summary

* The perceptron is a **flexible mathematical model**.
* The **perceptron trick** is useful but unreliable.
* **Loss functions**:

  * Quantify model performance.
  * Enable optimization via gradient descent.
* Different combinations of **activation + loss** yield:

  * Perceptron (Step + Hinge Loss)
  * Logistic Regression (Sigmoid + Cross-Entropy)
  * Softmax Regression (Softmax + Categorical Cross-Entropy)
  * Linear Regression (Linear + MSE)

---

✅ **Key Takeaway**:
The perceptron isn’t limited to binary classification. By changing its components, it generalizes to multiple ML models. Loss functions are the backbone of this flexibility.

Would you like me to also create **visual diagrams** (like the perceptron structure, hinge loss shape, and comparison of activation functions) to make your revision even easier?
