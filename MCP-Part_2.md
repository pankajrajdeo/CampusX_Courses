# MCP (Model Context Protocol) ‚Äì Architecture

## 1. Introduction to the "What" Aspect

* This section focuses on **what MCP is**, specifically its **architecture**.
* The full ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù series is divided into three parts:

  1. **Architecture** (covered here).
  2. **Lifecycle** (how client & server interact step-by-step).
  3. **Advanced concepts**.

This part covers the **architecture of MCP from first principles**.

---

## 2. Simplest Version of MCP Architecture

At the most basic level, there are **two entities**:

1. **Host**

   * The **AI chatbot** that interacts with the user.
   * Can be a ready-made chatbot (Claude desktop, Cursor IDE) or custom-built.
   * Behind the scenes, connected to an **LLM** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.).

2. **Server**

   * Represents a **tool or service** that performs specific tasks.
   * Examples:

     * GitHub server ‚Üí manage repositories.
     * Slack server ‚Üí read/write messages.
     * Google Drive server ‚Üí manipulate files.

üëâ All communication flows **between host and server**.

**Example**:

* User asks: *‚ÄúAre there any new commits on my GitHub repo?‚Äù*

  1. Host passes this to the LLM.
  2. LLM realizes it needs external data ‚Üí GitHub server.
  3. Host queries GitHub server.
  4. GitHub server checks repo and returns commits.
  5. LLM forms the final answer ‚Üí Host shows it to user.

## 3. Adding Refinement: The Role of the Client

* In reality, **hosts never directly talk to servers**.
* They need a helper called the **MCP Client**.

### MCP Client

* Acts as the **bridge** between host and server.
* Speaks the same MCP ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù as the server.
* Responsibilities:

  * Converts **high-level requests** from host into **MCP-compatible requests**.
  * Sends requests to server.
  * Translates **structured MCP responses** into a format host can understand.

üëâ **No direct host ‚Üî server communication. All passes via the client.**

---

## 4. One-to-One Relationship (Client ‚Üî Server)

* MCP defines a **strict one-to-one relationship**:

  * **One client can only connect to one server at a time.**
* If host needs multiple servers (GitHub, Slack, Drive):

  * It must use **separate clients**, one per server.

**Analogy**:

* Phone = Host
* SIM card = Client
* Airtel/Jio/Vodafone = Servers
* To connect to multiple networks, you need **multiple SIMs**.

---

## 5. Benefits of this Architecture

1. **Decoupling / Separation of Concerns**

   * Each server communication is isolated.
   * If GitHub line breaks, Slack/Drive still work.
   * Safer and more resilient.

2. **Scalability**

   * Add as many servers as needed.
   * Just install a new client per server.
   * Enables **parallel execution** (GitHub + Slack simultaneously).

---

## 6. Primitives: What Servers Offer to Hosts

**Primitives = offerings that servers provide to hosts.**
There are **three types**:

1. **Tools**

   * Actions that the host can ask the server to perform.
   * Examples:

     * GitHub: list commits, create issue, push code.
     * Drive: search files, create new file.

2. **Resources**

   * Static data sources (documents, schemas).
   * Examples:

     * GitHub: fetch README file.
     * Database: fetch schema.

3. **Prompts**

   * Predefined prompt templates + instructions that **guide the AI‚Äôs behavior**.
   * Example: *Issue Report Prompt* that enforces a clear format: title, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, environment.
   * Helps LLM produce **better structured requests** to the server.

---

## 7. Standard Operations for Each Primitive

MCP defines **standard functions** to interact with primitives:

1. **Tools**

   * `tools/list` ‚Üí Get available tools.
   * `tools/call` ‚Üí Execute a specific tool with arguments.

2. **Resources**

   * `resources/list` ‚Üí List available resources.
   * `resources/read` ‚Üí Read a specific resource.
   * `resources/subscribe` / `unsubscribe` ‚Üí Get notified on changes.

3. **Prompts**

   * `prompts/list` ‚Üí List available prompt templates.
   * `prompts/get` ‚Üí Fetch details of a specific prompt.

---

## 8. Data Layer

* Defines the **language & grammar** for MCP communication.
* Built on **JSON-RPC 2.0**.

### JSON-RPC 2.0

* Combines **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** with **JSON**.
* Allows executing functions on remote machines ‚Äúas if local‚Äù.
* Requests/responses structured in JSON.

**Example JSON-RPC Request**:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/list",
  "params": {}
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": ["listIssues", "listPulls"]
}
```

### Why JSON-RPC over REST?

1. Lightweight (no extra HTTP headers).
2. Supports **bi-directional communication** (server ‚Üí client requests).
3. Transport agnostic (works with stdio, HTTP, WebSockets, etc.).
4. Supports **batching** (multiple requests at once).
5. Supports **notifications** (fire-and-forget, no response needed).

---

## 9. Transport Layer

* Defines **how JSON-RPC messages travel** between client and server.

### Two Types of Servers

1. **Local Servers**

   * Run on the same machine as the host.
   * Use **STDIO (Standard Input/Output)** for transport.
   * Benefits: **fast, secure, simple**.

2. **Remote Servers**

   * Run on other machines (cloud, network).
   * Use **HTTP + SSE (Server-Sent Events)** for transport.
   * HTTP POST ‚Üí send JSON-RPC requests.
   * SSE ‚Üí stream results chunk-by-chunk (better for long tasks).

### Key Point

* **Data layer (JSON-RPC) is transport agnostic**.
* Same JSON-RPC message can travel over STDIO or HTTP.
* This flexibility is why Anthropic chose JSON-RPC.

## 10. Final Summary of MCP Architecture

* **Host** = AI chatbot.
* **Client** = Bridge between host and server (1:1 relationship).
* **Server** = External tool/service.
* **Server Primitives** = Tools, Resources, Prompts.
* **Standard Operations** = `/list`, `/call`, `/read`, etc.
* **Data Layer** = JSON-RPC 2.0 (request/response grammar).
* **Transport Layer** =

  * Local servers ‚Üí STDIO.
  * Remote servers ‚Üí HTTP + SSE.

**Benefits**:

* Decoupled, safe, scalable, parallel.
* Transport agnostic.
* Moves us closer to a **unified AI work partner**.

Would you like me to also **turn these notes into a diagram (visual architecture map)** so you can see host, client, server, primitives, data & transport layers all in one picture?
