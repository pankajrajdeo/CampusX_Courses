# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

## 1. Introduction

* MCP = **Model Context Protocol**.
* Gained popularity in the last year; expected to become an **industry standard in 3–5 years**.
* Motivation: Industry will require MCP integration in software.
* Playlist structure:

## 2. The Story of AI Adoption

### a) ChatGPT Launch (Nov 30, 2022)

* 1M users in 5 days; 100M in 2 months (fastest adoption ever).
* New kind of software: natural, human-like interaction.

### b) Three Stages of Adoption

1. **Stage of Pure Wonder** – Fun, curiosity-driven usage (creative/funny prompts).
2. **Professional Adoption** – Productivity boost (lawyers, coders, teachers used it for work).
3. **API Revolution** – OpenAI released APIs → AI embedded in tools (MS Word, Excel Copilot; Google Docs; AI-first tools like Cursor, Perplexity).

## 3. The Problem of Fragmentation

* Multiple AI tools exist (Notion AI, Slack AI, VS Code assistants, etc.).
* Each works in isolation → **fragmented AI worlds**.
* Users juggle multiple tools; context spread across systems.
* Desired: A **unified AI agent** that sees all work end-to-end.
* Biggest challenge: **Context Assembly**.

---

## 4. Understanding Context

* **Definition**: All information visible to an AI when generating a response.
* Examples of context:

  * Conversation history.
  * External documents, tickets, schemas, code, etc.
* **Professional reality**: Context is scattered across Jira, GitHub, databases, docs, Slack.
* Developers often act as **“human APIs”**, manually copy-pasting context.
* This is unscalable, inefficient, and time-consuming.

---

## 5. Function Calling & Tools

* Introduced mid-2023 by OpenAI.
* LLMs can call external functions to fetch/execute tasks.
* Example: Load a file, query a database, fetch weather, search the web.
* Explosion of tools followed (Slack bots, Drive connectors, HR tools, finance tools, Cursor, Perplexity, ChatGPT plugins).
* **Advantage**: Automated context fetching.
* **Limitation**: Integration nightmare (n × m functions for n chatbots × m tools).

  * High development, maintenance, security, and cost overhead.
  * Leads to “integration problem.”

## 6. MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### Core Idea

* Standard protocol for communication between AI clients (chatbots) and servers (tools/services).
* **Entities**:

  * **Client** = AI chatbot (ChatGPT, Cursor, Perplexity, etc.).
  * **Server** = Tool/service (GitHub, Google Drive, Slack, databases).
* Communication language = MCP.

### Difference from Function Calling

* In function calling: Developers must write custom code for each integration.
* In MCP:

  * Heavy lifting done by the **server**.
  * Client just connects → no custom code needed.
* Example: GitHub MCP server handles authentication, error handling, data formats; chatbot simply connects.

## 7. Benefits of MCP

1. **Reduced Integrations**

   * Before: n × m integrations.
   * Now: n + m (each tool builds its own MCP server once).
2. **No Maintenance Overhead**

   * Updates handled on server side.
3. **Lower Cost & Faster Setup**

   * Day-one connectivity with existing MCP servers.
4. **Better Security**

   * Centralized config file with credentials instead of scattered API keys.

---

## 8. Why MCP Will Become an Industry Standard

* Major AI clients (Claude, Cursor, Perplexity) **publicly support MCP**.
* Pressure on services (GitHub, Slack, Google Drive, etc.) to create MCP servers.
* **Network effect**:

  * More MCP clients → more MCP servers.
  * More MCP servers → more clients adopt MCP.
* Ecosystem growing exponentially.
* Services not adopting MCP risk isolation and higher costs.

---

## 9. Conclusion

* MCP solves both **context assembly** and **integration problems**.
* Moves us closer to the vision of a **unified AI work partner**.
* Expected to become an **industry standard in 3–5 years**.
* Next step: Learn the technical architecture of MCP (*The What*).
