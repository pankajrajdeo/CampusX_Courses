## 2. Why Start This Playlist? (3 Main Reasons)

### a. Timing

* Current moment is **perfect** to learn Agentic AI.
* **Why now?**

  * Agentic AI is trending across platforms (YouTube, Twitter, Instagram).
  * Leaders and CEOs of big companies are highlighting its importance.
  * Generative AI tools (since ChatGPT’s 2022 launch) have matured enough to enable **powerful AI agents**.
  * In next 5 years, AI agents will create massive value.
  * Learning **agentic applications** now positions learners to be highly valuable in the future.

### b. Demand

* Huge request from subscribers—**every third comment** in last 3–4 months asked for LangGraph.
* Industry-wide buzz around LangGraph.

### c. Build-Up

* The channel has been progressing systematically:

  1. Machine Learning
  2. Deep Learning
  3. LangChain & Generative AI
* Naturally, the next logical step is **LangGraph and AI Agents**.

## 3. Vision Behind the Playlist

* **Observation of existing content**:

  * Some YouTube content teaches **projects directly** (but weak fundamentals).
  * Some explains **basic fundamentals** (but too short, lacking depth).
  * **No comprehensive, end-to-end resource** exists.

* **Decision**: Create a **30–50 video comprehensive playlist** that covers both fundamentals and practical applications.

### Goals (3 Main Objectives)

1. **Beginner-Friendly Application Building**

   * Even complete beginners should be able to build agentic applications confidently.

2. **Strong Fundamentals of LangGraph**

   * Learners will gain **deep command** of the LangGraph framework.

3. **Conceptual Depth Beyond Tools**

   * Focus on **core concepts** so that if LangGraph is replaced by another framework in future, students can adapt easily.
